# Iot-based-Real-time-Message-Display-with-ESP32-and-Web-Interface
Thrilled to share a collaborative project built by our 5-member team, where software meets hardware! 👨‍💻🔧  We developed a real-time system where: 💬 A message typed on a custom web interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) ➡ Is sent wirelessly over Wi-Fi to an ESP32 microcontroller ➡ Then displayed instantly on a 128x64 OLED screen 📟
